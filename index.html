            <p>Actually, there's no good formula for this. It's a very case-by-case situation, so if you like consistency, you won't like this at all. Usually what I start off with is to just scroll out the overflow, then go down and see if there are any obvious protrusions. That's the best case scenario. But sometimes you will get ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù elements, like maybe it's an ad but you're using an Adblocker.</p>
            <p>But it's like detective work, right? If every robbery or murder can be investigated the same way, then police department do what? A more worse case scenario is just brute force it. Meaning, open the inspector, then from the immediate child level of the body element, start removing elements and see if the overscroll goes away. Then keep digging into the children, the grandchildren, the great-grandchildren, until you reach the 18th level of hell and find the offending element.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>Sometimes, it's because the layout code has some slight issues, where something is not allowed to shrink properly. Maybe it's a <code>min-width</code> value on a grid item, for example. I can understand why you would want a minimum width for things in a grid, especially images, because you don't want things to shrink to a ridiculously tiny size.</p>
          <p>Instead of using <code>min-width</code>, let the browser do the calculation by using the <code>minmax()</code> function. Then the browser will figure out how many columns you need. And you can still tweak until you happy. But okay, maybe there's an awkward width where no matter how much you tweak, at some point it looks weird. Are you stuck? NO!</p>

            <p>Sometimes, it's not a layout issue per se. Maybe your items got some really really long string that the browser doesn't break up by default. Browsers are generally quite smart, and know how to speak many languages, you know why? Becaus dictionary. Anyway, line-breaking and word-breaking is a very non-trivial issue, beyond the scope of this talk, but I will link some nice video in the end, even though I doubt any of you will watch.</p>
            <p>If the string doesn't really need to stay together, the easy way out is to <code>word-break: break-all</code>. Problem solved. It's an inheritable property, so you can put it on the container or the item, up to you.</p>

            <p>Browsers can do hyphenation, but it's a bit iffy still. Hyphenation is set to manual by default. When it is manual, it means you have to ownself hyphenate things. Like if you want hyphens that are always visible, then you use <code>U+2010</code> or <code>&amp;dash;</code>, while for invisible hyphens, use <code>U+00AD</code> or <code>&amp;shy;</code>.</p>
            <p>But this only makes sense if you have complete control over the content and markup. If you're not the one writing the content, can you even coordinate all your content writers to use <code>&amp;shy;</code> in their writing? What if you're using markdown? Then your content ends up a weird hybrid of HTML and markdown.</p>
            <p>Browsers can do automatic hyphenation, but you must have the <code>lang</code> attribute set correctly. Incorrect hyphenation makes the text really difficult to read. Browsers use dictionaries to figure out when hyphenations need to kick in, so tell your browser what language your content is in.</p>
            <p>Even though browser support is reasonable, you try viewing this in Chrome, the hyphenation a bit off. It is what it is.</p>

            <p>Nested scrolling happens when both page and a component has scrolling. There will be a stacked scrollbar. When users scroll inside the component, the page will stay at the same scroll position. When the component scroll position is at its bottom, try scrolling the component in the same direction ‚Äî usually, it will resume scrolling the page, which is intended, as the internal overflow has finished scrolling.</p>
            <p>But a tricky situation can happen when it sometimes doesn‚Äôt scroll the outer page. When this happens, the page is ‚Äústuck‚Äù at that scroll position as it constantly triggers the scrolling of the inner component only. Us developers ‚Äúpower users‚Äù may realize that we‚Äôre stuck in the inner scrollbar and therefore we can carefully put our fingers in the margin area and manually trigger the page scrolling again. But users may not be able to learn to do that and hence get themselves trapped.</p>

          <h2>‚Ä¶then how?</h2>
          <p>First, ask yourself:</p>
          <ul style="max-width:20em">
            <li class="fragment">Is it <em>really</em> necessary?</li>
            <li class="fragment">If it is ‚Äî
              <ul>
                <li class="fragment">give the page <em>enough margin</em> so it is easier for users to scroll the page when intended</li>
                <li class="fragment"><em>differentiate</em> inner component and page more clearly, display the scrollbar, etc.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Before trying to tackle this problem perhaps we can first ask ourselves whether the situation is really necessary. Webpages intrinsically grow taller as the content grows, and phone screens are just a palm size, what‚Äôs behind the necessity of having some nested region encapsulating long content instead of letting it grow the page naturally?</p>
            <p>And if the nested scrolling is deemed necessary, we need to help our users not get trapped in the stacked scrollbar situation. Differentiate the regions more clearly, and make sure the page has enough margin so users can scroll the page easily.</p>

          <h2>If stacked scrolling due to iFrame‚Ä¶</h2>
          insert video here
          <aside class="notes">Sometimes the stacked scrolling may be introduced by iFrame. For example in the past two years all climbing gyms in town required booking. And usually they embed the booking system on their website using iFrame. After the iFrame loads page, which is usually a long table displaying timeslots, it introduces a scrollbar in the iFrame and that often trapped me there.</aside>

        <section>
          <h2>‚Ä¶then how?</h2>
          <p>You can consider:</p>
          <ul style="max-width:28em">
            <li class="fragment">Statically setting the iFrame height to be a known height that is enough for its inner content</li>
            <li class="fragment">Dynamically setting iFrame height
              <ul>
                <li class="fragment">Better UI</li>
                <li class="fragment">Has limitations though: if same domain - parent can set height according to content window height; if different domain - need <code>window.postMessage</code> to communicate height of the embedded site (see <a href="https://usefulangle.com/post/65/javascript-automatically-resize-iframe">Change Iframe Size Automatically to Fit Content & Prevent Scrollbars</a></li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>One na√Øve solution is the set the iFrame to be a sufficient height for its inner content. This works best if the inner content has fixed height. Otherwise we may leave the parent page with empty space when the inner content isn‚Äôt really that tall, and there‚Äôs no guarantee that the inner content won‚Äôt past our predetermined height.</p>
            <p>A more programmatic solution is to set the height of the iFrame when the inner content of the embedded page finishes loading. This is not difficult if the inner page is of the same domain, in which case parent page has direct access to the embedded page‚Äôs scroll height via <code>contentWindow.body.scrollHeight</code>. Otherwise, the two pages need to communicate using <code>window.postMessage</code> which means the inner page has to implement the relevant event for the parent page to tap into to get its height.</p>

            <p>This is a very interesting case that I think may be valuable to some of us who are building a rather complex web app.</p>
            <p>Imagine your app is originally built for big, desktop screens, perhaps a complex dashboard. So the whole app assumes, say, a <code>min-width: 1024px</code>. And now the app is mature with many intricate features, built and supported by a few teams. And one day, your PM comes to you and say, ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs time that we ship for tablets, because from our tracking data many users are using iPads.‚Äù</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So they give you an iPad and you open the app, because the whole app has min-width: 1024px, it now introduces a horizontal overflow when you hold the app in portrait mode, as the effective resolution is 834px.</p>
            <p>Your goal is to make it minimally usable on tablets, and horizontal overflow is deemed not acceptable. So how? Do you go take down that min-width: 1024px and then try to fix every component that breaks because you now ship for a smaller viewport? However you may want to fix them yourself, it may not be feasible because you may not even be able to know all the logical conditions of the whole app for each component to show.</p>

          <p style="max-width:32em;text-align:left;margin:auto;margin-bottom:1em">The <strong>visual viewport</strong> is the part of the page that‚Äôs currently shown on-screen. The user may scroll to change the part of the page he sees, or zoom to change the size of the visual viewport.</p>
          <p style="max-width:32em;text-align:left;margin:auto">However, the CSS layout, especially percentual widths, are calculated relative to the <strong>layout viewport</strong>, which is considerably wider than the visual viewport.</p>

          <aside class="notes">This is very old technology. Ever since the very early days of mobile browsers, they come with two viewports. A visual viewport which is roughly how big the mobile screen is, and a layout viewport which the mobile browser gives your webpage for layout purpose, so your CSS media queries will receive the dimensions of the layout viewport, not the visual viewport. Note that the dimensions of the layout viewport can be much bigger than the visual viewport, that‚Äôs how mobile browsers in the old days shrunk down very big desktop websites down to those tiny screens.</aside>

          <h2><code>viewport</code> meta tag in action</h2>
          <p>Demo time!</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I want to show you using my iPad what happens when I specify the meta viewport tag to be 890px, where my Nintendo Switch page is about 830px wide. Now, you can see how the viewport width stays at 890px, however I change orientation. And by giving my app this layout viewport bigger than its min-width, it will always scale nicely and there will be no horizontal overflow.</p>
            <p>This is not a trick. Personally speaking, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs hacky at all. Because if you don‚Äôt set any viewport meta tag at all, and if the browser sees your content is much wider than the mobile screen, on iPad / iOS it will render a default layout viewport sized of 980px with initial scale of 1. I think we as users are are so used to this behavior we don‚Äôt even think eh how come my site is much bigger but it renders just nice on my iPad mini?</p>
